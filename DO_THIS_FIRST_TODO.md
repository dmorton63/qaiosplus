I was analysing the system naming conventions and realized something:

1.)  Everything thing begins with Q....
2.)  That Q stands for Qaios.

if we decide to refactor naming standards, it would require relacing one Letter.
Every Folder, module, and namespace begins with Q  -  the fix - replace the Q with C

That should bring everything into the Citadel arena
